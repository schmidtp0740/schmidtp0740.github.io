Hello! My name is Philip Schmidt and I am from St. Paul, MN. In my free time I like to work on side projects to create tools to support cloud services, game on PC or Xbox, travel, go to local events. I am also learning how to speak Portuguese since I frequently visit Brazil to visit family from time to time. My career path is focused on being a customer facing developer creating tools to support cloud services.

I create applications mainly for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and stepping into GCP. I love to work with Golang and Docker, I would say they are my two favorite technologies. I continually quest to learn new technologies, methodologies, and workflows.
